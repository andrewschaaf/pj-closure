This is a direct conversion of
[Google's Closure Library](http://code.google.com/closure/library/)
from JavaScript syntax to Python syntax, intended for use with
[PYXC-PJ](http://pyxc.org)

The conversion is from SVN rev 380. After that, this project will follow any SVN updates.

### Converted
* All of goog/math/math.js and its prereqs

### TODO
* Convert the rest!
* Write a script that somehow runs all of Closure's unit tests on this
